                    While Dieting and exercising app are thriving in the market, these app are not as helpful when it comes to helping people understand their mental condition and how their mental problem are related to their physical health. In fact, dietary restraint is associated with increased binge eating episodes among those with Binged-eating disorder, BED(ELRAN-BARAK, Roni, et al., 2015)
                    <br>
                    By promoting knowledge and information of obesity associated mental disorder, the judgement caused by misunderstanding shall be lifted and citizens will be able to seek help in all kinds of aspect according to their needs.
