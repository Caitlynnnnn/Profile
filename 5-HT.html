                    While Dieting and exercising app are thriving in the market, these app are not as helpful when it comes to helping people understand their mental condition and how their mental problem are related to their physical health. In fact, dietary restraint is associated with increased binge eating episodes among those with Binged-eating disorder, BED(ELRAN-BARAK, Roni, et al., 2015)
                    <br>

It would also influence the long-lasting emotional state, appetite and sleep on individuals. Serotonin's association with mood is most known for various forms of depression, anxiety and bipolar disorders in humans, meaning that individuals who lack sufficient 5-HT in their system are more prone to suffer from these mental disorder.

                    There are tremendous amount of app regarding diets, calories and exercise, but there are next to zero app that specifically focus on mental health related obesity.
