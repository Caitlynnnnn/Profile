                    While Dieting and exercising app are thriving in the market, these app are not as helpful when it comes to helping people understand their mental condition and how their mental problem are related to their physical health.

                <p>It was fun and a satisfying start for my first ever UX/UI Case study. There was lots of constraints and incomplete in this case study. I would love to enlarge the interview base if possible. I would love to learn the design system and utilize it in this project. It would be fun to receive feedbacks from user testing. Hope someday I will be able to design and actually see my design coming true!
